# Cybersecurity_lab

This is a cybersecurity lab that I built on my local computer using VMware Workstation. It contains the following tools:

•  <b>Windows 10</b>: This is the host operating system that I use to run the virtual machines and other tools.

•  <b>Windows Serve 2012</b>: This is a server operating system that I use to simulate a target network and host various services and applications.

•  <b>Kali Linux</b>: This is a Linux distribution that contains a collection of penetration testing and hacking tools. I use it to scan, exploit and analyze the target network and systems.

•  <b>OWASP Broken Web Apps</b>: This is a virtual machine that contains a set of vulnerable web applications. I use it to practice web application security testing and learn about common web vulnerabilities and attacks.

•  <b>Metasploitable2</b>: This is another virtual machine that contains a deliberately insecure Linux system. I use it to practice network security testing and learn about common network vulnerabilities and exploits.

<b>Features</b>
•  The virtual machines are connected to a virtual network that allows communication between them.

•  The virtual machines are configured with dynamic IP addresses.

•  The virtual machines are isolated from the host network and the internet to prevent accidental damage or exposure.

•  The virtual machines are snapshots of the original images, so they can be restored to their initial state if needed.
